    "Because sample statistics are imperfect representations of the true population values, it is often appropriate to state these estimates with **confidence intervals**.\n",

    "Suppose I weigh a sample of 50 jellybeans from a population of 10000 and find the average weight to be 1.25 grams. Can I take this figure to be a good estimate of the average weight over the whole *population* of jelly beans?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a word, yes. (What else do I have to go on!?) But what I want now is a more or less precise way of indicating that this figure, though likely close to the real population mean, is inexact.\n",

    "Here's another example: Suppose our Indian correspondent (or David Attenborough) takes several hundred measurements of parrot beak lengths in the Ganges river basin and calculates (correctly!) an average beak length of 9cm. He reports this measure by saying that the 90%-confidence interval is (8.6, 9.4).\n",
    "\n",
    "This does NOT mean that the true population mean beak length has a 90% chance of being somewhere between 8.6cm and 9.4cm. After all, the true mean either falls in that range or it doesn't. The notion of probability *here* doesn't seem to make much sense. Rather, what our correspondent means is that, if we were to conduct the same measuring experiment many times, constructing intervals in the same way, we should expect 90% of those intervals to contain the true population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "OK: So how do we construct these intervals?\n",
    "\n",
    "The confidence interval we construct will depend on the statistics of our sample. It will depend in particular on (i) our sample mean and (ii) our sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will also depend on the underlying distribution of our data. If our data are **normally** distributed, then we can proceed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, the confidence interval will be centered on our sample mean. To construct the endpoints we step out from the center with a step size equal to the standard error, $\\large\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$. The number of steps we take is determined by which level of confidence we want attached to our interval: In particular, we take $z$-many steps, where $z$ is the (two-tailed) z-score that corresponds to our chosen level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our data are **not** normally distributed, then there are several strategies we might try, some of which ultimately depend on some connection to the normal distribution, like a strategy that appeals to the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
